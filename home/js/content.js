I enjoy embracing the lessons learned from new opportunities, so I can continue to grow. <br> <br> In Software Development I have knowledge in related topics such as Object-Oriented Program, Data Structures, Programming with Classes, Programming with Functions, and more. This has enabled me to create games (see GitHub repositories on my personal website). <br> <br>In Web Development I have built different websites from scratch, through GitHub Pages. I have created a website using PHPMyAdmin as a database. My personal website uses MVC architecture. This has allowed me to make the process of adding information through JASON files to the website more efficient. ";
